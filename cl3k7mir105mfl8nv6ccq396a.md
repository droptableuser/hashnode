## 5 Lessons from 5 Months as a Manager of Cybersecurity

Sharing 5 learnings from 5 months as a manager for cybersecurity:

- Get your direct reports as close to the working level as possible. The more they interact with everyone else in the company, the better you can target your efforts. Decentralize security.

- There are more things to fix and secure than you can ever deal with. Prioritize and execute.

- Empowering developers and service owners to make security-minded decisions is key. Tools, knowledge, best practices, and guidance. Simplicity and clarity are key.

- Don't wait for the perfect solution. Get a solution/decision in place and move on from there. There is no perfect solution. Cover and move.

- Learning is fundamental. If you're not learning, you're wasting your time. Track your journey and share it. Keep your ego in check.
